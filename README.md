Digital Certificates Schema Project
===================================

The schema project describes how to make a digital certificate. A digital certificate is essentially a JSON file with
the necessary fields needed for our issuer code to place it on the blockchain. We tried to keep the schema as close to
 the [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) specifications as possible.
