## Blockchain Receipt


Provides evidence of the certificate on the blockchain, using the chainpoint v2 standard

The schema defines the following properties:

### `@context` (string, required)

This should always be chainpoint v2 JSON LD context

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `https://w3id.org/chainpoint/v2`

### `type` (string)

type of hash. Currently the only supported hash type is SHA256, with chainpoint type ChainpointSHA256v2.

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `ChainpointSHA256v2`

### `targetHash` (string, required)

hash of item being verified. Currently the only supported hash type is SHA256, and the targetHash format is validated accordingly.

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}`

### `merkleRoot` (string, required)

Merkle root value â€“ this is anchored to the blockchain. Currently the only supported hash type is SHA256, and merkleRoot format is validated accordingly.

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}`

### `proof` (array, required)

how to walk the Merkle tree from the target item to the Merkle root

The object is an array with all elements of the type `object`.

The array object has the following properties:

`left` (string)

value of left neighbor to combine into parent hash. Currently the only supported hash type is SHA256, and this value format is validated accordingly.

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}`

`right` (string)

value of right neighbor to combine into parent hash. Currently the only supported hash type is SHA256, and this value format is validated accordingly.

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}`

### `anchors` (array, required)

How the proof is anchored to the blockchain.

The object is an array with all elements of the type `object`.

The array object has the following properties:

`type` (string)

Type of anchor, e.g. BTCOpReturn. Currently the only supported value is BTCOpReturn.

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `BTCOpReturn`

`sourceId` (string, required)

How to lookup the proof on the blockchain. Currently this is expected to be the (value of the) Bitcoin transaction id, and this value format is validated accordingly

Additional restrictions:

*   Regex pattern: `[A-Fa-f0-9]{64}`
