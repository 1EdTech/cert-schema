# Welcome to cert-schemaâ€™s documentation

The cert-schema project describes how to make a digital certificate. A digital certificate is essentially a JSON file with
the necessary fields needed for our issuer code to place it on the blockchain. We tried to keep the schema as close to
the [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/) specifications as possible.

###Certificate format

- [Certificate Schema V1](certificate-schema-v1-1.md)
- [Issuer Schema V1](issuer-schema-v1-1.md)
