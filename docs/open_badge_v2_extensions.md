# Blockcerts Proposed Extensions to Open Badges V2

The [Open Badges specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/index.html) is maintained by [IMS Global](http://www.imsglobal.org/). While developing Blockcerts, we created 4 Open Badge v2-compliant extensions. 2 of these are specific to blockchain verification; the other 2 are extensions we found useful. All are being offered as official Open Badge extensions to IMS Global Learning Consortium

## Summary of extensions

- (Required for blockchain verification) blockchain verification type `MerkleProofVerification2017`, ideally as an enum added to the current verification options "hosted", "signed"
- (Required for blockchain verification) `signature` proof as an Open Badge extension; defined by:
    - [W3C LD Signature Specification](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/)
    - [Merkle Proof Signature Suite](https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/lds-merkleproof2017/)
- `recipientProfile` for identifying recipients
  - `RecipientProfile` extends the `Profile` type and adds `publicKey` for embedding a recipient's public key
- `signatureLines` as a image/signer array, intended for display in the certificate

## Example

Following is an example of a Blockcerts certificate. Note that this is fully OBv2 compliant. It uses the Open Badge `Extension` type to identify Open Badge extensions. These are marked in the example with `<` markers.

## Considerations for adopting as official Open Badge extensions

- The current extension type/term names are not assumed to be final; it's expected that we will iterate on them during Open Badges review
- Signature lines are currently defined in the `badge` type instead of the  `assertion` type. I understand that this should likely move to `assertion` per OB extension best practices
- The prefix `ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:` 
    - This is not final and is being Digital Verification subgroup of the W3C Credentials CG
    - The problem was that examples like this `ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:msBCHdwaQ7N2ypBYupkp6uNxtr9Pg76imj` are not quite correct
        - The value right of the colon is a base58 encoded ecdsa koblitz public key hash
        - Currently the approach used by others in the community is to keep the `ecdsa-koblitz-pubkey:` and actually list the public key (not the hash)
        - The problem is readability (e.g. bitcoin addresses vs longer public keys)
        - Another option would be to invent a new prefix
    - Alternately, a more forward looking approach would be to use (or reserve) DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) for this purpose. 
- Are there any special considerations in using the 2017 Merkle Proof Signature Suite from the W3C?
- How do we integrate Blockcerts verification into the OB verifier?
- How do we add the blockchain/blockcerts verification "type" (i.e. signed/hosted/...)

## Extension schemas and context

### Json-ld context

The Json-ld context is listed in the context array of a blockcert. It defines these extension terms. See [https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2](https://w3id.org/blockcerts/v2)

### Json schemas

- MerkleProofVerification2017 is proposed as a new type enum to the current set of verification types
