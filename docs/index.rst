Welcome to cert-schema's documentation!
=======================================

The cert-schema project describes how to make a digital certificate. A digital certificate is essentially a JSON file with
the necessary fields needed for our issuer code to place it on the blockchain. We tried to keep the schema as close to
the `Mozilla Open Badges <http://openbadges.org/>`_ specifications as possible.
